I wasn't sure about the instructions for how we are suppossed to set it up:

for client, the port # is hardcoded in the file itself at the top, right now it is 5431. 
for server, you push as a command line argument the port # it is supossed to listen to.

so to run this you would do:

./httpd 5431

./client localhost


Also, I did not complete the bonus req so don't worry about it.
